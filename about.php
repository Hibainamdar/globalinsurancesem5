Life Insurance can be defined as a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurance company,
 where the insurer promises to pay a sum of money in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured person or after a set period. Here, at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, you pay premiums for a specific term and in return, we provide you with a Life Cover. This Life Cover secures your loved ones’ future by paying a lump sum amount in case of an unfortunate event.
 In some policies, you are paid an amount called Maturity Benefit at the end of the policy term.

<b>
Benefits of life Insurance</b>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Term Insurance:</b><br> Term insurance plans provide life cover to protect your loved ones at most affordable
 rates. This is the simplest form of life insurance. Term plans offer financial security to your 
 loved ones’ future even in your absence.
</li>
<b>Savings Plan:</b> <br>Savings Plans are life insurance plans that combine the benefits of a life insurance cover
 and investment. So, in addition to securing yourself and your family, you also create a corpus to meet 
 your financial goals at every life stage. Most protection and savings plans usually offer you a fixed 
 amount as Maturity Benefit when the policy ends, but some specific plans also help you create a regular
  stream of income throughout your policy duration
<li>
<b>Other Benefits: </b><br>As an innovative feature, OPD expenses are now covered under few Insurer plans and don’t require hospitalization for minimum 24 hrs to claim reimbursement. Stand alone OPD plans are also available in the market.
